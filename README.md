# Discord-Bot-for-Birthday
This is a template to build a discord bot that runs on [replit](replit.com). It is coded in python and mainly utilises the discord library. The bot can be used to celebrate an event or a person by automated commands displaying messages, photos, videos, embeds and random percentage games. 
Placeholders are given to write the person's name, messages etc. Pictures/videos must be added to the same folder after being titled "pic3.jpg" and "vid1.mp4" and so on.
I'd recommend watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) on youtube to understand how to arrange the files/tokens on replit. 

**The objective of this project is to create a template by which the user can follow said tutorial with minimal writing of code or understanding of the algorithms.**

To add the original discord bot to your server (**NSFW WARNING!**), use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=843365060684546089&permissions=534723947584&scope=bot).
